Here’s how to avoid the top 5 pitfalls in 2025.</p><h3>1. Overtrading</h3><p>Chasing every dip burns $50-$100 in fees. Stick to 2-3 trades/week—$500 at 5% gain = $25 vs. $50 lost to commissions.</p><h3>2. No Plan</h3><p>Random buys flop—$1,000 in a meme stock can tank 50%. Set targets: buy at $10, sell at $12—20% gain = $200.</p><h3>3. Ignoring Risk</h3><p>All-in bets wipe out—$2,000 on one stock risks 100% loss. Diversify: $500 each in 4 stocks caps loss at 25% ($500).</p><h3>4. Emotional Trades</h3><p>Panic-selling a 10% dip loses $100 on $1,000. Hold for recovery—historical 7% annual return = $70 profit.</p><h3>5. Skipping Research</h3><p>Blind picks fail—$1,000 in a hyped stock drops 30%. Study P/E ratios, news—$1,000 in a solid firm grows 15% ($150).</p><h3>Example</h3><p>Sam puts $1,000 in a hot stock, overtrades, loses $200. With a plan—$250 in 4 stocks, 10% gain—he nets $100 ($1,100 total).</p><p class='conclusion'>Avoid these traps—plan, diversify, research. Trade smart, and stocks pay.</p></article>",
